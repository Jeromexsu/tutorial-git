# initialize a new project
```
git init
```

# git add - add new files, stage changes, explained 

```
git add <file> [files]
```
you can use . to add all files in the working directory

git add is used both for new and newly modified files, and in both cases it takes a snapshot of the given files and stages that content in the index, ready for inclusion in the next commit.

# making changes
Modify some files, then add their updated contents to the index use git add.
You can see what is about to be committed using git diff with the --cached option.
```
git diff --cached
```
(Without --cached, git diff will show you any changes that you’ve made but not yet added to the index.)

# view project history
```
git log
```
use `-p` to see complete diffs at each step
use `--stat --summary` to get a nice summary

# branch
use `git branch` to create a new branch. We will create a new branch called beta in this project 
and modify this file on each branch.
